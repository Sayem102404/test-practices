            <h3>Become a Professional Web Developer</h3>

            <p><b>Web Developers</b> are the programmers who specialize in the development of web applications and
                interfaces. I genuinely have interest in learning, so web development is easy to pick up and with the
                right
                tools I can quickly gain solid coding skills. If I work hard enough, I can get a dream job in one of the
                big
                companies specializing in tech products, such as-Google! In those environments, I usually will get to
                work with
                large, diverse teams of web developers.</p>
